            The HBO level suits me because...
        </h3>
        <p>
            I moved down a level from VWO to HAVO, and VWO usually moves up to
            the University and HAVO to a HBO study. This let me decide that I
            did not want to try University later, and went for HBO.

            The study programme suits my personality because...
        </h3>
        <p>
            I've always liked coding, even in High School. Coding requires a
            problem-solving attitude, and not a problem-making attitude.
            Hereby, being creative can help a lot. There are always multiple
            ways to the goal, but what way is the fastest and simplest?
            Most people always pick the wrong queue at a supermarket,
            but not me. I'm mostly in the faster queue.
            This, I think, gives a good sight of my level of judgement (as in
            making conclusions based on what you see, and making the right
            decision).
