                    I moved down a level from VWO to HAVO, and VWO usually moves up to
                    the University and HAVO to a HBO study. This let me decide that I
                    did not want to try University later, and went for HBO.

                    I've always liked coding, even in High School. Coding requires a
                    problem-solving attitude, and not a problem-making attitude.
                    Hereby, being creative can help a lot. There are always multiple
                    ways to the goal, but what way is the fastest and simplest?
                    Most people always pick the wrong queue at a supermarket,
                    but not me. I'm mostly in the faster queue.
                    This, I think, gives a good sight of my level of judgement (as in
                    making conclusions based on what you see, and making the right
                    decision).
