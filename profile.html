            <p>
                My name is Rick Torreman, I'm 18 years young and I 
                live in Stellendam. Stellendam is located in the province
                of "Zuid-Holland" and belongs to the township of
                Goeree-Overflakkee. This township officially belongs to
                the province of Zuid-Holland, but is often confused by
                outsiders that it belongs to the province of Zeeland.
                This leads to irritation under the older inhabitants.
                But I'll stop typing about that subject for now, before
                I keep on going with no ending. Like everyone, I also
                have some characteristics that are either positive, or
                need to be improved. Here is a quick overview:
