            <p>
                My name is Rick Torreman, I'm 18 years young and I 
                live in Stellendam. Stellendam is located in the province
                of "Zuid-Holland" and belongs to the township of
                Goeree-Overflakkee. Like everyone, I also
                have some characteristics that are either positive, or
                need to be improved. Here is a quick overview:
            </p>
            <h4>Positive characteristics/Strenghts:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Helpful. I tend to help a lot of people when they need
                    it, however, it will take a while before I actually
                    walk up to them, especially when I don't know them
                    very well (yet).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keeping an eye on detail. I'm usually the one who finds
                    errors in a code, or notices that something is missing
                    like a ';' or a forward slash to define the end of
                    something.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Friendly. I consider myself friendly because I don't like
                    it when people argue in a negative way. Even giving
                    negative feedback, because of a super bad presentation
                    given due to no preparation, is something I don't like to
                    do. This could also be seen as a negative thing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Less favorable characteristics/Points of improvement:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Overemotional. I can be very emotional. For example:
                    I'm watching a serie and someone has to cry in that serie
                    because her husband died. This husband was also shown earlier
                    in the serie and had a role in the serie aswell. Of course
                    the lady has to cry, but I also have some flowing tears.
                    Not as much as her, but still a few.
