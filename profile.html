            <p>
                My name is Rick Torreman, I'm 18 years young and I 
                live in Stellendam. Stellendam is located in the province
                of "Zuid-Holland" and belongs to the township of
                Goeree-Overflakkee. Like everyone, I also
                have some characteristics that are either positive, or
                need to be improved. Here is a quick overview:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Helpful. I tend to help a lot of people when they need
                    it, however, it will take a while before I actually
                    walk up to them, especially when I don't know them
                    very well (yet).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keeping an eye on detail. I'm usually the one who finds
                    errors in a code, or notices that something is missing
                    like a ';' or a forward slash to define the end of
                    something.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Friendly. I consider myself friendly because I don't like
                    it when people argue in a negative way. Even giving
                    negative feedback, because of a super bad presentation
                    given due to no preparation, is something I don't like to
                    do. This could also be seen as a negative thing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Overemotional. I can be very emotional. For example:
                    I'm watching a serie and someone has to cry in that serie
                    because her husband died. This husband was also shown earlier
                    in the serie and had a role in the serie aswell. Of course
                    the lady has to cry, but I also have some flowing tears.
                    Not as much as her, but still a few.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distracted. I get distracted by my surroundings pretty fast.
                    I'm working on improving this, so hopefully it will be way
                    less in my upcoming years.

            <h2>My Hobbies.</h2>
            <p>
                I kinda like everything, but the hobbies I do the most are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gaming. I really like gaming and I really want to go to
                    some kind of competition for any game once. But I still need
                    to practice a lot before that dream can become true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Socialising. I also like to hang out with friends and do
                    entirely nothing. Just having fun is the best way to relax.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sporting. I might not look that active or healthy with sport,
                    but that's not a reason to dislike it. I like to play football
                    the most. I also didn't have any judge against the PE lessons
                    at school. I liked them actually.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="Profile-Family">
            <h2>My Family.</h2>
            <p>
                I live with my parents. My father is called Jos and my mother is
                called Lenie. I don't have any siblings or pets. We used to have
                goldfishes in our pond in our garden. This also attracted frogs,
                which we hate because they make loud noises in the night, so we
                decided to give them a better place and remove the pond. It has
                been replaced by some kind of mancave or shelter for when it
                starts to rain when we are BBQ'ing. We also had one cat, Timmy.
                He, unfortunately, had to be put to sleep because there was
                something wrong with his thyroid. This happened a few years ago.

            <h2>Previous School.</h2>
            <p>
                RGO Middelharnis was the high school I went to. It was a very fun
                school, with lots of activities outside and school trips. We went
                to London for a day, had an exchange with a school in Slovakia and
                we went to Berlin in our pre-exam year. The school also organised
                a musical every year, which I liked to participate in. We have
                performed 5 different musicals. We practiced for another one, but
                because of COVID-19, we had to cancel the performance. This
                happened in my exam year, so I didn't really have a way to say
                goodbye. It was just over.
